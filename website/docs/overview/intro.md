# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è CloudCatalog will help you document your AWS architecture in no time.

‚ö°Ô∏è CloudCatalog is designed to help you document and capture your resources, services and owners.

‚ö°Ô∏è Ease of use, developer experience and managing maintenance overhead is key to this project. That's why we try to focus on simplifying the experience.

## Motivation

In 2022 we created [EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/), a tool that allows you to document your event-driven architecture. **CloudCatalog** is a fork of [EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/), that allows you to document your AWS architecture.

When documenting architectures we tend to lean to architecture diagrams, [OpenAPI Specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/) or custom wikis that help us document our systems but can we do more?

What if we could:

- Document resources in seconds
- Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to document our architecture.
- Enrich our documentation with [custom components](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Group AWS resources in services and assign owners ([users](/docs/overview/guides/users/introduction) or [teams](/docs/overview/guides/teams/introduction)) to them
- Help developers understand our architecture with simple diagrams and markdown content, and more...

Say hello to **CloudCatalog**.

**CloudCatalog is designed to help people understand, document and discover their AWS Architectures.**

We can do so much more to document our Architectures.

CloudCatalog is Open Source and hopefully it can add value to your teams.
