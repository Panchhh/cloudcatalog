# Introduction

**Services** allow you to group and document a collection of [resources](/docs/overview/guides/resources/introduction).

You can group your [resources](/docs/overview/guides/resources/introduction) into services using the `service` field of your resource frontmatter.

You can also assign owners to your services, owners can be people or teams.

### What do services look like in CloudCatalog?

![Service Example](./img/Service.png)

**CloudCatalog** provides many features when documenting your services:

- **Resources** - Link resources to your services and Catalog will display them for you.
- **Owners** - Document owners of your services so others know who to contact. These can be users or teams.
- **Custom Components** - Powered by MDX you can add extra components to your resource pages

Next, let's look at how we can add some Services.
