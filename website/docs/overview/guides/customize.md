# Customise CloudCatalog

With CloudCatalog you can customise your Catalog.

### Logos & Favicons

When you initialise your CloudCatalog folder you will have a `public` directory.

You can replace the `logo.svg` and `favicon.ico` files here. The changes will then be shown on your Catalog.

### Title & Description

You can change your Catalogs title and description, you can find more details in the [cloudcatalog.config.js API](/docs/api/cloudcatalog.config.js)
