### What does this function do?

This Lambda function is tailored for handling user sign-ups in an application. When a new user registers, the function is triggered, taking charge of validating the provided user information, such as email addresses and passwords, for accuracy and adherence to security standards. It then proceeds to create a new user account in the application's database. During this process, the function ensures compliance with data protection regulations, encrypts sensitive information, and may integrate with external services for tasks like email verification or CAPTCHA validation. Post successful registration, the function generates a confirmation response, which can include user IDs or verification tokens, and initiates an automated email or notification to the user to confirm their successful sign-up and provide any further instructions or welcome messages.
