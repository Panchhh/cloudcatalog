### What is this service?

The User Service, implemented as a collection of AWS Lambda functions, offers a comprehensive and scalable solution for managing user-related operations in an application. This service efficiently handles tasks such as user registration, authentication, profile management, and password recovery. When a new user signs up, a Lambda function processes the registration, ensuring data validation and secure storage of sensitive information.

For user login, another function manages authentication, leveraging secure protocols to verify user credentials. Profile management is facilitated through a Lambda function that allows users to update their personal details, while maintaining the integrity and privacy of user data. Additionally, the service includes a password recovery function, which implements secure methods to assist users in resetting their credentials. The modular nature of this service ensures high availability and scalability, catering to a diverse user base while maintaining a seamless user experience.
